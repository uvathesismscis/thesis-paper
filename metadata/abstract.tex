Suboptimal indoor air quality (IAQ) poses health risks and affects the cognitive performance of occupants within indoor environments. Despite growing awareness, there is a significant gap in communicating IAQ data to occupants. This study addresses this gap by developing 'Bluebird,' an interactive data physicalization that visualizes real-time air quality data to enhance occupant awareness. Using a user-centered mixed-methods approach, this study employs post-occupancy evaluation (POE) methods within the Lab42 case study building to elicit occupantsâ€™ understanding of IAQ ($f$=29) and utilizing air quality monitors to collect and measure CO$_{2}$ concentrations within meeting rooms (30-day period). The insights guide the development of the data physicalization which was subsequently evaluated and usability-tested with occupants ($n$=5). The results reveal a need for more awareness among users regarding indoor air quality highlighting that CO$_{2}$ concentrations regularly exceed the optimal threshold within meeting rooms. Evaluations of the data physicalization indicate that real-time environmental data can effectively increase occupants' awareness and help them take preventive action.
