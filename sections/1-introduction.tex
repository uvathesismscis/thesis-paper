\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Globally, people are estimated to spend approximately 90\% of their time indoors \cite{schweizer_indoor_2007, klepeis_national_2001} and breathe 11.000 liters of air per day \cite{corlan_importance_2021}. Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions affect building occupants' experiences of comfort, and insufficient ventilation in indoor environments is proven to play a significant role in occupants' well-being, health, and cognitive functions \cite{, wang_how_2021, kim_analyzing_2019}. 

The overall indoor environmental quality (IEQ) influences the perceived comfort of occupants consisting of several key metrics (e.g., mechanical ventilation, temperature regulation, natural lighting) to create a combined IEQ index for a specific indoor space \cite{kulshreshtha_indoor_2024}. Among these metrics, indoor air quality stands out as a crucial factor deserving special attention due to its invisibility to occupants \cite{son_perceived_2023}; polluted air goes undetected by smell or sight, underscoring the importance of monitoring and maintaining optimal indoor air quality. Furthermore, mechanical ventilation systems in buildings operate discreetly and are frequently insufficient for ventilation in densely populated small rooms like meeting rooms, laboratory offices, or hot-desking work areas \cite{silva_post-occupancy_2017}, which contributes to occupants' perceived lack of control. These systems are typically automated \cite{persily_challenges_2015} and cannot be directly regulated or controlled by occupants themselves \cite{kim_automatic_2019}. 

This creates an interplay between occupants' effects on comfort, built environments, and computing technologies (see \hyperref[fig:complexity]{Figure \ref*{fig:complexity}}) researched in an overarching interdisciplinary field of study, known as Human-Building Interaction (HBI) \cite{alavi_introduction_2019}. This research specifically focuses on understanding occupants' needs through in-the-wild \cite{rogers_moving_2017} studies gaining insight into occupants' awareness, collecting indoor air quality data in designated spaces, prototyping data physicalization devices to visualize indoor air quality, and using these designs as data probing tool \cite{zimmerman_research_2007} evaluating their effectiveness with the overarching objective of obtaining insights into occupants' comfort levels and facilitating their adoption of preventive measures against poor indoor air quality \cite{zhong_complexity_2021}. 

While research on defining comfort within indoor buildings \cite{alavi_comfort_2017}, gathering and analyzing sensory air quality data \cite{corlan_importance_2021} and the effects of poor air quality are prevalent \cite{klepeis_national_2001}, there remains a research gap in understanding occupants' behavior and their subjective needs, along with limited research on design solutions that display environmental data and computing installations communication data to building occupants for awareness, particularly within the field of physically visualizing data to convey IAQ to building occupants in real-time.

\subsection{Research questions}

In order to research intervention strategies for improving indoor air quality, the following main research question is formulated: \\

\emph{RQ: How can real-time sensory measurements and future predictions of indoor air quality be physically visualized to increase awareness among occupants, facilitating their adoption of preventive measures against suboptimal air quality?}\label{rq:1} \\

To effectively answer this central research question, the following supporting sub-questions ("sq" for "subquestion") guide this research and serve as objectives to delineate the necessary knowledge:

\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{SQ\arabic{enumi}:}
    \item \emph{How aware are occupants of their perception of indoor air quality and their understanding of its subjective properties?}\label{subq:1}
    \item \emph{How can environmental information related to indoor air quality be incorporated into a physical data-driven representation as a design artifact?}\label{subq:2}
    \item \emph{How does the post-installation evaluation of a prototype design solution impact occupants' awareness and willingness to adopt preventive measures?}\label{subq:3}\\
\end{enumerate}
