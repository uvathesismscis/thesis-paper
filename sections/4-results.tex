\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
% Give the outcomes for each research question in the form of a table or graphic (with caption).
Write about your results here. Good captions to tables and/or figures are key.

% Sometimes,  especially  if  you  have  quite  different experiments or research  questions,  it makes sense to interleave the experimental setup and the results sections, so the reader does not get lost. It is then helpful to structure clearly in (sub)subsections.
