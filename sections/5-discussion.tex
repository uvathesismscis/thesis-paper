\label{sec:discussion}
% Compare your results with the state-of-the-art and reflect upon the results and limitations of the study. You can already hint at future work to which you come back in the conclusion section.

\subsection{Ethical considerations}

\subsection{Limitations}

\subsubsection{Validity}

\subsubsection{Prototype scalability}
Concessions were made during the creation of the prototype. Limitations in time, hardware availability and technical limitations. 

\subsubsection{Generalizability}
Tested within the Lab42 building, so it's hard to test effectiveness are scalable to other university buildings.

\subsection{Future work}

Future work, the prototype to communicate more sensory properties. We envision fabric that holds water to communicate humidity etc. made of organic materials etc.
