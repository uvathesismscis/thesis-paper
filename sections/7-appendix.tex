\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{appendix:acknowledgements}

My sincere gratitude to all the participants who generously contributed to this study by dedicating their time to respond to the surveys and questionnaires voluntarily, as well as those who willingly tested and interacted with the prototype. Special appreciation goes to everyone who supported me in data analysis, provided hardware for the prototypes, and reviewed and tested the code for the hardware devices.

A thank you to supervisor, Dr. H. Seiied Alavi (University of Amsterdam), for his invaluable guidance, thought-provoking questions, and overall assistance throughout the project and Shruti Rao PhD Candidate (University of Amsterdam) for her constructive feedback and suggestions, which further expanded this research. Also, my sincere appreciation to all the reviewers of this research for their insightful comments and contributions.

\section{Ethical considerations}
\label{appendix:ethical}

Before user studies were conducted, an application to the Ethics Committee for Information Sciences (ECIS) \footnote{https://ivi.uva.nl/research/ethical-code/ethical-code.html} about the methodology of this research, how data is being gathered and stored was made. Advice from the committee is still pending.

All individuals participating in the survey and evaluation process were obliged to confirm their voluntary involvement by carefully reading and signing a letter of consent, with the assurance that they retained the right to withdraw from participation at any point without the need for explanation. Participants were informed about the goal of the study and the structure of the interviews. To uphold confidentiality and privacy, survey participation occurred anonymously, and all evaluation interview data underwent anonymization following the conclusion of the evaluation sessions.

Interacting with occupants within the building and interacting with participants of the usability tests of the prototype adhered to the the principles outlined in the UvA code of conduct \footnote{https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/policy-and-regulations/}.

\section{Domain Expert Validity}
\label{appendix:experts}

Prior to conducting the questionnaire survey and evaluation procedure, a domain expert from the Informatics Institute at the University of Amsterdam reviewed the methodologies involved. First versions were send out to staff for feedback internally. The surveys and interviews were tested internally as pilot tests and then distributed to participants and open for participation. 

\section{Data storage and archival}

\section{Questionnaire survey (POE)}
\label{appendix:survey}

\textbf{Introduction:}\\

Hi! We at the Digital Interactions Lab (DIL) are researching indoor environments, focusing on Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) within smart buildings like Lab42, for a Master Thesis. This survey takes an average of $\sim$3 minutes to complete and comprises questions about your overall comfort and awareness of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).

The survey is anonymous and collects data on environmental experiences and approximate building location for future research and publication.
